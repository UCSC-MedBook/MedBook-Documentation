## Sample labels
[//]: # (Should we name this section Sample IDs?)

Sample labels can be any arbitrary string. A study can define a pattern that sample labels must match. Studies can also turn off pattern matching so users can load any sample label without pattern matching. In this case, Wrangler will warn the user that pattern matching is turned off but will not stop the user from loading the data.
